## 5. Plot Visuals

#The age distribution indicates that the majority of employees fall within the 35 to 45 age range, with an average age just under 40. However, the presence of outliers, including individuals over 60 and as young as 21, contributes to a wider diversity in age across the workforce.


boxplot(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Age, main="Age Distribution", col="orange")


#The salary distribution suggests that most employees earn relatively lower weekly wages, estimated as weekly pay multiplied by 100. While there are a few notable outliers—likely due to higher-paying positions—the majority of employees typically earn between $200 and $1000 per week.


boxplot(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Salary, main="Salary Distribution", col="yellow")


#Overall, the data suggests that employees are generally satisfied, with 5 representing the highest satisfaction level and 1 the lowest. The minimal number of employees rating their satisfaction as 1 indicates that the workplace is perceived as more favorable than unfavorable.


boxplot(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Satisfaction, main="Satisfaction Distribution", col="blue")


#The data shows that most employees have been with the company for at least four years, indicating a relatively experienced workforce.


boxplot(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$YearsExperience, main="Years of Experience Distribution", col="green")

# Histograms
#The age histogram offers a clear visual representation of the distribution, showing that most employees are middle-aged, with the majority falling between 30 and 40 years old.


hist(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Age, main="Age Distribution", col="purple", xlab="Age", breaks=10)

#The age histogram provides an easy-to-interpret view of the distribution, highlighting that the majority of employees are middle-aged, primarily between 30 and 40 years old.


hist(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Salary, main="Salary Distribution", col="pink", xlab="Salary", breaks=10)

#The Satisfaction Score histogram shows that most employees rated their satisfaction as 5 (very satisfied). While the specific reasons behind their ratings are not provided, this suggests that the company is generally viewed as a positive and enjoyable workplace.


hist(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Satisfaction, main="Satisfaction Score Distribution", col="red", xlab="Satisfaction", breaks=10)


#The Years of Experience Histogram reveals that while the majority of employees have five years of experience, nearly as many have only one or two years. This suggests that this organization frequently brings on new hires, albeit in smaller numbers than more seasoned staff members.

hist(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$YearsExperience, main="Years of Experience Distribution", col="darkgreen", xlab="Years of Experience", breaks=10)

#The barplot illustrates that the majority of employees are assigned to Department 1, indicating a higher concentration of staff in this division compared to others.


barplot(table(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Department), main="Employee Count by Department", col="darkgreen", ylab="Count", xlab="Department")

# Relationship between Salary and Years of Experience
#The plot indicates little to no correlation between years of experience and salary, suggesting that the company determines employee compensation based on factors other than tenure.

plot(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$YearsExperience, Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Salary, main="Salary vs Years of Experience", xlab="Years of Experience", ylab="Salary", col="gray", pch=19)

# Relationship between Salary and Satisfaction
#The plot reveals that while employees with lower salaries often rated their satisfaction as 1, many who gave a five-star rating earned similar wages. This suggests that factors beyond salary, such as benefits, work environment, or company culture, may contribute to overall job satisfaction.
